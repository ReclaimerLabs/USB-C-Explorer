/**
 * \defgroup asfdoc_sam0_dma_group SAM Direct Memory Access Controller (DMAC) Driver
 *
 * This driver for Atmel&reg; | SMART ARMÂ®-based microcontrollers provides an interface for the configuration
 * and management of the Direct Memory Access Controller(DMAC) module within
 * the device. The DMAC can transfer data between memories and peripherals, and
 * thus off-load these tasks from the CPU. The module supports peripheral to
 * peripheral, peripheral to memory, memory to peripheral, and memory to memory
 * transfers.
 *
 * The following peripheral is used by the DMAC Driver:
 * - DMAC (Direct Memory Access Controller)
 *
 * The following devices can use this module:
 *  - Atmel | SMART SAM D21
 *  - Atmel | SMART SAM R21
 *  - Atmel | SMART SAM D09/D10/D11
 *  - Atmel | SMART SAM L21/L22
 *  - Atmel | SMART SAM DA1
 *  - Atmel | SMART SAM C20/C21
 *  - Atmel | SMART SAM HA1
 *  - Atmel | SMART SAM R30

 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_dma_module_overview Module Overview
 *
 * SAM devices with DMAC enables high data transfer rates with minimum
 * CPU intervention and frees up CPU time. With access to all peripherals,
 * the DMAC can handle automatic transfer of data to/from modules.
 * It supports static and incremental addressing for both source and
 * destination.
 *
 * The DMAC when used with Event System or peripheral triggers, provides a
 * considerable advantage by reducing the power consumption and performing
 * data transfer in the background.
 * For example, if the ADC is configured to generate an event, it can trigger
 * the DMAC to transfer the data into another peripheral or SRAM.
 * The CPU can remain in sleep during this time to reduce the power consumption.

 * The DMA channel operation can be suspended at any time by software, by events
 * from event system, or after selectable descriptor execution. The operation
 * can be resumed by software or by events from the event system.
 * The DMAC driver for SAM supports four types of transfers such as
 * peripheral to peripheral, peripheral to memory, memory to peripheral, and
 * memory to memory.
 *
 * The basic transfer unit is a beat, which is defined as a single bus access.
 * There can be multiple beats in a single block transfer and multiple block
 * transfers in a DMA transaction.
 * DMA transfer is based on descriptors, which holds transfer properties
 * such as the source and destination addresses, transfer counter, and other
 * additional transfer control information.
 * The descriptors can be static or linked. When static, a single block transfer
 * is performed. When linked, a number of transfer descriptors can be used to
 * enable multiple block transfers within a single DMA transaction.
 *
 * The implementation of the DMA driver is based on the idea that the DMA channel
 * is a finite resource of entities with the same abilities. A DMA channel resource
 * is able to move a defined set of data from a source address to destination
 * address triggered by a transfer trigger. On the SAM devices there are 12
 * DMA resources available for allocation. Each of these DMA resources can trigger
 * interrupt callback routines and peripheral events.
 * The other main features are:
 *
 * - Selectable transfer trigger source
 *  - Software
 *  - Event System
 *  - Peripheral
 * - Event input and output is supported for the four lower channels
 * - Four level channel priority
 * - Optional interrupt generation on transfer complete, channel error, or channel suspend
 * - Supports multi-buffer or circular buffer mode by linking multiple descriptors
 * - Beat size configurable as 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit
 *
 * A simplified block diagram of the DMA Resource can be seen in
 * \ref asfdoc_sam0_dma_module_block_diagram "the figure below".

 *   </table>
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_dma_module_overview_dma_channels DMA Channels
 * The DMAC in each device consists of several DMA channels, which
 * along with the transfer descriptors defines the data transfer properties.
 * - The transfer control descriptor defines the source and destination
 * addresses, source and destination address increment settings, the
 * block transfer count, and event output condition selection
 * - Dedicated channel registers control the peripheral trigger source,
 * trigger mode settings, event input actions, and channel priority level
 * settings
 *
 * With a successful DMA resource allocation, a dedicated
 * DMA channel will be assigned. The channel will be occupied until the
 * DMA resource is freed. A DMA resource handle is used to identify the specific
 * DMA resource.
 * When there are multiple channels with active requests, the arbiter prioritizes
 * the channels requesting access to the bus.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_dma_module_overview_dma_trigger DMA Triggers
 * DMA transfer can be started only when a DMA transfer request is acknowledged/granted by the arbiter. A
 * transfer request can be triggered from software, peripheral, or an event. There
 * are dedicated source trigger selections for each DMA channel usage.

 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_dma_module_overview_dma_transfer_descriptor DMA Transfer Descriptor
 * The transfer descriptor resides in the SRAM and
 * defines these channel properties.
 *   <table border="0" cellborder="1" cellspacing="0" >
 *    <tr>
 *        <th> Field name </th> <th> Field width </th>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *     <td > Descriptor Next Address </td> <td > 32 bits </td>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *     <td > Destination Address </td> <td> 32 bits </td>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *     <td > Source Address </td> <td> 32 bits </td>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *     <td > Block Transfer Counter </td> <td> 16 bits </td>
 *    </tr>
 *    <tr>
 *     <td > Block Transfer Control </td> <td> 16 bits </td>
 *    </tr>
 *   </table>
 *
 * Before starting a transfer, at least one descriptor should be configured.
 * After a successful allocation of a DMA channel, the transfer descriptor can
 * be added with a call to \ref dma_add_descriptor(). If there is a transfer
 * descriptor already allocated to the DMA resource, the descriptor will
 * be linked to the next descriptor address.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_dma_module_overview_dma_output DMA Interrupts/Events
 * Both an interrupt callback and an peripheral event can be triggered by the
 * DMA transfer. Three types of callbacks are supported by the DMA driver:
 * transfer complete, channel suspend, and transfer error. Each of these callback
 * types can be registered and enabled for each channel independently through
 * the DMA driver API.
 *
 * The DMAC module can also generate events on transfer complete. Event
 * generation is enabled through the DMA channel, event channel configuration,
 * and event user multiplexing is done through the events driver.
 *
 * The DMAC can generate events in the below cases:
 *
 * - When a block transfer is complete
 *
 * - When each beat transfer within a block transfer is complete

 *
 * This is a list of the available Quick Start Guides (QSGs) and example
 * applications for \ref asfdoc_sam0_dma_group. QSGs are simple examples with
 * step-by-step instructions to configure and use this driver in a selection of
 * use cases. Note that a QSG can be compiled as a standalone application or be
 * added to the user application.
 *
 * - \subpage asfdoc_sam0_dma_basic_use_case
 *
 * \note More DMA usage examples are available in peripheral QSGs.
 * A quick start guide for TC/TCC
 * shows the usage of DMA event trigger; SERCOM SPI/USART/I<SUP>2</SUP>C has example for
 * DMA transfer from peripheral to memory or from memory to peripheral;
 * ADC/DAC shows peripheral to peripheral transfer.
